<h1>SPACE SHOOTER</h1>

Welcome to Space Shooter game! This game is developed with JavaScript. As soon as the game starts, aliens begin to approach our spacecraft. The objective is to shoot them without letting them escape. Each hit on an alien adds +1 point to your score. Your health starts at 100, and for each missed alien, your score decreases by -10 points. When you hit a first aid kit, your health increases by +10 points. However, it's important to note that some aliens come at a faster pace. Focusing on them and shooting them first is crucial. Have fun!
